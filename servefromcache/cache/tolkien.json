Tolkien worked between 1922 and 1928 on his Clarendon edition Selections from Chaucer's Poetry and Prose, and though never completed, its 160 pages of commentary reveals much of his thinking about language and storytelling when he was still at the threshold of his career as an epoch-making writer of fantasy literature. Drawing upon other new materials such as his edition of the Reeve's Tale and his Oxford lectures on the Pardoner's Tale, this book reveals Chaucer as a major influence upon Tolkien's literary imagination.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780198842675"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0198842678"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":336,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eGOtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eGOtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=eGOtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA299&dq=tolkien&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=eGOtDwAAQBAJ&dq=tolkien&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Tolkien_s_Lost_Chaucer.html?hl=&id=eGOtDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"PL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"PL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=eGOtDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"<b>Tolkien</b>, J.

Bilbo's life is never to be the same again. The Hobbit became an instant success when it was first published in 1937, and more than 60 years later Tolkien's epic tale of elves, dwarves, trolls, goblins, myth, magic and adventure, with its reluctant hero Bilbo Baggins, has lost none of its appeal.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0008108285"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780008108281"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":400,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Baggins, Bilbo (Fictitious character)"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":10,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6-KfzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6-KfzQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=6-KfzQEACAAJ&dq=tolkien&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=6-KfzQEACAAJ&dq=tolkien&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Hobbit.html?hl=&id=6-KfzQEACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"PL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"PL","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=6-KfzQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"1DlAAQAAIAAJ","etag":"ayVc34RfYs8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1DlAAQAAIAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Tolkien Studies","publishedDate":"2009","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"STANFORD:36105211721910"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Electronic journals"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.1.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1DlAAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1DlAAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=1DlAAQAAIAAJ&q=tolkien&dq=tolkien&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=1DlAAQAAIAAJ&dq=tolkien&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Tolkien_Studies.html?hl=&id=1DlAAQAAIAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"PL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"PL","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1DlAAQAAIAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"JEg8PgAACAAJ","etag":"qZdTH2EmFOc","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JEg8PgAACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Tolkien","subtitle":"A Biography","authors":["Humphrey Carpenter"],"publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","publishedDate":"1977","description":"The authorized biography of J.R.R.
